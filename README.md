# Movie Project

This is a movie database project, where it shows movies, their casts, ratings, trailers, related movies, genres, and so on.

This project uses The Movie DB API: `https://api.themoviedb.org/3`. It is up to
you to use your Google and Postman skills to explore the API and understand the
data.

### What to do in class
- Load the genres when the app loads, use the useEffect hook to fetch them.
- Create a MoviePage component. The component will be mounted when the user clicks a movie item in the grid. The grid should hide.
- In the MoviePage, use the effect hook to load the movie based on the movie_id prop.
- The MoviePage component should have a back button that when clicked, will return to the grid view.
- It is preferable that you use async/await to load the movie inside the MoviePage component.

### Homework
In class, you have created a 2 pages application. The first page is the MovieGrid, the second one is the MoviePage. While this approach works, but for large applications with many pages, we require a routing library that makes things easier for us.

Let’s explore the react-router-dom library, and refactor our app to use this library and make our pages routing professional.

Tasks: 
- When the user clicks a movie item it should go to `/movie/${movie.title}` using the react-router and render the movie page which is basically the `MoviePage` component
- When the user goes back using the browser’s back button, the app should send him to the previous page.
- When the user clicks the logo or home button, it should also send them to the grid or main page
- Organize the content inside the movie info and you should at least have an
    - Image
    - Title
    - Release date
    - Overview
    - rate
    - Genres (you will need to fetch all the genres and do some comparison do get the name of the genres)
    - Trailers of this movie (which will include another fetch)
    - Actors of this movie (which will include another fetch)
### Style
Be creative here it is your project, make it stand out!
	



# Version 3
updated at Jun 27 2:00 pm
### What to do in class
- add a function inside the `app.js` called `handleQuery(query)` it will handle the change of the input in the `SearchBox`, pass it to The `Navbar` component and then pass it to the `SearchBox` component and `onSubmit` of your search form, use this function to pass the search query back to the `app.js` you should pass the query to the `Main` component as a prop too, finally console.log(props.query) inside your `Main` component.

- have another function called `handleMovies(movies)` which will do the same as `handleQuery(query)` function but instead when user Submit the form you should search for the input using the `constructUrl` function passing it the search path and query, and then return the results into the main component using the handler function, read the following points when implementing

- use this function with fetch and don’t change it, the `path` is basically whatever your are requesting after the `TMDB_BASE_URL` for example `search/movie`

```jsx
const constructUrl = (path, query) => {
  return `${TMDB_BASE_URL}/${path}?api_key=${atob(
    "ZDJmYTdhZDFlMjZhZjA4NDdkMzQ5ZDdkYmQ1ZjkzZTU="
  )}&query=${query}`;
};
```

- checkout this for more info about the search api endpoint
  https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies

- In the `Main` component send the movies to another component that will render the movies and lets call it `MoviesGrid`.
- In the `MoviesGrid` map each movie to another component called `MovieItem`.

### Homework

- Go to the TMDB documentations and see how you can get all the genres (the categories) and how to get popular movies in this category
- add a button in the navbar, when clicked it should fetch the genres 
- Render the genres as options inside the genres dropdown
- when you change categories from the dropdown it should fetch the popular movies in that category
- update the grid with the movies you got when selector chenges


# Version 2

Updated Jun 27, 2:00 pm

### What to do in class

- Add a Spinner component to the Navbar component and make it invisible by default also pass a function called `onSearch` to the SearchBox and then when you type some text inside the SearchBox component, call it to make the spinner in the Navbar component appears. You can use spinners from here https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/spinners/

### Styling

feel free to style the movies list but we suggest making it as a grid and each movie has the poster and title under it, maybe call effect when hovering or something or hide the title and show it when hovering, don't know be creative with it

### Keywords:

- create-react-app
- npx

### Make sure to:

Add a universal navbar (it appears on every page) to the home page that includes
buttons that go to the following pages:

- Home button, takes you to the home page.
- Search box where you can type the movie or actor name and display the

### Footer Component

Add a universal footer that includes:

- Credit to you and your partner for building the website,
- You and your partner's github link inside an icon and optionally, your social
  media links.

### Styling

- you can style the components yourself, import the stylesheet from JavaScript, not in HTML
- Optionally: you can use react-bootstrap library. Search on how to install it and get started using it

# Homework
